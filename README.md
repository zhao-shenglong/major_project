# IDEA9103 Major Project - Functioning Prototype (Individual Part)
## The 'individual_code' folder above contains all necessary files to run the prototype.

- **How to interact**
    - If you open the prototype you will see particles drawing in a beautiful shape that gradually form an image - *The Scream*, though it will look a bit adstract.
    - Moving your mouse left and right can control the size (width) of the drawing particles
    - Moving your mouse up and down can shift the colour between all black and the original one.
    - Clicking your mouse can clear the page and the particles will re-generate.

- **Details of approach**
